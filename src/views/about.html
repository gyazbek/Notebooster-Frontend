    <p>
    NoteBooster.com provides students with the opportunity to optimize collaborative learning while empowering purpose driven student organizations. For every note you sell, you choose both the percentage you donate, starting at 24%, and the organization you donate to.

    <!-- <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
    <p class="mbot50">
        NoteBooster.com is a student-to-student marketplace for class notes, built to simultaneously enhance the educational process & purpose driven student organizations. This service is far from new, in fact it exists at hundreds of campuses across the country. What is new is that 24-100% of each transaction goes directly to the purpose driven organizations on your campus.
