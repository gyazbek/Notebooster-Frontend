    <p class="mbot50">
        NoteBooster.com is a student-to-student marketplace for class notes, built to simultaneously enhance the educational process & purpose driven student organizations. This service is far from new, in fact it exists at hundreds of campuses across the country. What is new is that 24-100% of each transaction goes directly to the purpose driven organizations on your campus.

            <p>Who We Play For is a movement to protect the hearts of our youth by providing affordable heart screenings. Every single dollar we raise through NoteBooster goes towards providing student athletes, who otherwise couldn't afford it, with the opportunity to get their heart checked. Please consider joining our fight against the leading cause of death in student athletes, sudden cardiac arrest. </p>
