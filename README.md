# Notebooster Angular

Frontend code for Notebooster into a mostly single page app.
Features include social authentication, user profiles, document upload, and many more.

The project relies on a REST api backend that contains proprietary code that may still be in use, so that is not included. Most features that do rely on API calls can be easily reimplemented by analysing the promises and what they expect in return.
